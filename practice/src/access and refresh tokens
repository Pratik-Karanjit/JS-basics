Access token is used to generate the user's initial token which allows authorization and lasts for a certain amount of time. When the time runs out, the refresh token 
is called and it acts as the new token. Replaces the access token.

Refresh token stays in the redux state unless the access token expires and is invoked only at the time of need.
